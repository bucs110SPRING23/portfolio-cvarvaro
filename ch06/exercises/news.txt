Article: England hit by triple injury blow ahead of Italy and Ukraine qualifiers
Marcus Rashford and Mason Mount have withdrawn from the England squad to face Italy and Ukraine in this week’s Euro 2024 qualifiers.

Rashford picked up a knock in Manchester United’s win over Fulham in the FA Cup quarter-finals on Sunday, while Mount will remain at Chelsea in order to recover from a minor injury.

Neither player has been replaced in Gareth Southgate’s squad, but Tottenham goalkeeper Fraser Forster has been added after Nick Pope also withdrew due to injury.

Pope reported an injury following Newcastle’s win over Nottingham Forest on Friday and the 35-year-old Forster has received his first call up since March 2022.

England begin their European Championship qualifying campaign against Italy in Naples on Thursday before hosting Ukraine at Wembley on Sunday.
